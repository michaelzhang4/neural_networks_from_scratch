1. Introduce multiple features #
2. Binary classification #
3. Multinomial Logistic Regression #
4. Feedforward Neural Network
		- Softmax/Sigmoid outputs depending on 				number of classes #
		- Random initialisation on weights/biases #
		- Calculate stochastic gradient descent on
		weights (Chain Rule)
5. CNN
		- Feature pooling by majority more 1s = 1 			overall
		- Convolutions by taking an average
6. RNN
7. Attention
8. Transformers
