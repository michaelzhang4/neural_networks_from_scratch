# Feed-Forward Neural Network from Scratch

I made this project to gain a foundational understanding of neural networks.
This project implements least squares regression, binary logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression and finally a feed-forward neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/michaelzhang4/Neural_networks_from_scratch.git
    cd Neural_networks_from_scratch
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn cassiopeia pandas
    ```
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
